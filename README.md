### What is it?

Statika is a simple application written in Golang, that acts as a proxy between end-user and the file storage (i.e. S3-compatible or local file storage). 
As a proxy it's going to provide some basic value on top of it:

- Basic per-bucket and per-file statistics
- Hooks support
- Extensible pre/post moderation support
- Transparent RAID1 mode
